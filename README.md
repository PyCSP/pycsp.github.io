# PyCSP project

The PyCSP project is an on-going project project to bring CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) to Python. The main goals of this project is to support our research projects, teaching and scientific programming.

We are in the process of moving development activity to [this GitHub organization](https://github.com/PyCSP). 
The following are links to releases and development branches of PyCSP. 


* [aPyCSP](https://github.com/PyCSP/aPyCSP) is a re-implementation of PyCSP for asyncio and coroutines and uses Python 3.6+. This was presented at CPA 2018. 

* [PyCSP-locksharing](https://github.com/PyCSP/PyCSP-locksharing) a multithreaded implementation that uses concepts from aPyCSP. 
  
Older / inactive versjons: 

* [The initial PyCSP](http://www.cs.uit.no/~johnm/code/PyCSP/) web page with the first iterations of PyCSP using multithreading. 

* [PyCSP classic](https://github.com/PyCSP/pycsp_classic) is the old 0.3.0 version ported to Python 3.0. It is used as a reference implementation for the newer branches. 

* [PyCSP](https://github.com/runefriborg/pycsp) a fully featured implementation with multiple backends (threads, multiprocessing and greenlets). 

  - See also the [PyCSP 0.9.2 wiki](https://github.com/runefriborg/pycsp/wiki) for more information . 
  - This version is currently not maintained. 

* [aPyCSP lockver](https://github.com/PyCSP/aPyCSP_lockver) is an experimental branch of PyCSP that used an inefficient and complicated approach when porting to coroutines and asyncio.
