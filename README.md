# PyCSP project

PyCSP is a project investigating and providing CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes), or process oriented programming in Python. 

We are in the process of moving development activity to this GitHub
organization. The following are links to releases and development branches of PyCSP. 



* [http://www.cs.uit.no/~johnm/code/PyCSP/](The initial PyCSP) web page, with the first iterations of PyCSP using multithreading. 

* [https://github.com/runefriborg/pycsp/wiki](PyCSP 0.9.2) with support for threads, multiprocessing and greenlets. 

* [https://github.com/jmbjorndalen/pycsp_classic](PyCSP classic) is the old 0.3.0 version ported to Python 3.0. It is used as a reference implementation for the newer branches. 

* [https://github.com/jmbjorndalen/aPyCSP](aPyCSP) is a re-implementation of PyCSP for asyncio and coroutines and uses Python 3.6+. 

  - [https://github.com/jmbjorndalen/aPyCSP_lockver](PyCSP lockver) is an experimental branch of PyCSP that used an inefficient and complicated approach when porting to coroutines and asyncio. 


The aPyCSP implementation was presented at CPA 2018.
